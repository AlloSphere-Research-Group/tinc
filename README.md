# TINC (Toolkit for Interactive Computation)

This repository contains the TINC library.

# Using TINC

We have set up to repositories to assist learning and using TINC. The [tinc-playground](https://github.com/AlloSphere-Research-Group/tinc-playground) is a quick way to build and explore the examples included with TINC. It provides a convenience run script to easily build single file applications, or build all the examples. The [tinc-template](https://github.com/AlloSphere-Research-Group/tinc-template) repo shows how to set up a more complex project using TINC as a submodule through CMake. This template is useful to build larger applications made from multiple files or with multiple target that might require additional dependencies.
